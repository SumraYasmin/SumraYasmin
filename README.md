## Hi there 👋  
I'm **Samra Yasmin**!

👩‍💻 I'm a full-stack developer with over **6 years** of experience working with **Ruby on Rails**, **React**, **Next.js**, **TypeScript** and **Python** — building scalable, maintainable, and user-focused web applications.

🔌 I enjoy integrating APIs, optimizing performance, and collaborating with cross-functional teams to ship features that matter.  
🛠️ I also explore **Next.js**, **PostgreSQL**, and **CI/CD pipelines**, and I'm continuously learning to improve my craft.

🌱 Currently diving into the world of **AI tools**, **prompt engineering**, and a bit of **Python** experimentation.  
👩‍👧 Outside the terminal, I’m a mom, storyteller, and an avid learner trying to balance code and creativity.

📫 Reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumra-yasmin-fullstack-developer/) or email me at **sumrayasmin9@gmail.com**  
⚡ **Fun fact**: I love simple storytelling and sometimes imagine turning code problems into children’s tales (no kidding!).
